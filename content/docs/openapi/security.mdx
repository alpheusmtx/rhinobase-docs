description: Add security definitions to your OpenAPI specification

You can add security definitions to your OpenAPI specification by using the `security` property in the `openAPIRouteHandler` function.

```ts
main.get(
  "/openapi.json",
  openAPIRouteHandler(app, {
    documentation: {
      components: {
        securitySchemes: {
          bearerAuth: {
            type: "http",
            scheme: "bearer",
            bearerFormat: "JWT",
          },
        },
      },
      security: [
        {
          bearerAuth: [],
        },
      ],
      servers: [
        {
          url: "http://localhost:3000",
          description: "Local server",
        },
      ],
    },
  })
);
```

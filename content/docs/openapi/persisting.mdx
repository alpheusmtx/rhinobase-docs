title: Saving Spec
description: Save the spec to a file for cache or any other external use
---

The `openAPIRouteHandler` function creates the OpenAPI specification and store it in a global variable, which can work as cache in a stateful environment like a Node.js server. However, this will not work in serverless environments where the app is restarted frequently. In such cases, you can generate the OpenAPI spec and save it to a file, this way you can serve the spec from the file instead of generating it on each request. And based upon your provider, you can also cache this.

<Callout>
_openAPIRouteHandler_ only computes the OpenAPI spec when the route is accessed. It does not compute the spec on app initialization.
</Callout>

## JSON

This simple script will generate the OpenAPI spec and save it to a JSON file. You can run this script whenever you make changes to your routes or when you want to update the OpenAPI spec.

```ts
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { generateSpecs } from 'hono-openapi';

// Your Hono app
import mainApp from "./app";

async function main() {
    const specs = await generateSpecs(mainApp, {
        // Documentation metadata
    });

    fs.writeFileSync('./path/to/openapi.json', JSON.stringify(specs, null, 2));
}

main()
```

<Callout title="Note">
This script might not work if you are hiding routes conditionally, as the `generateSpecs` function will require the context of the request to determine which routes to include in the spec. You might wanna use a different approach to generate the spec in such cases.
</Callout>

## YAML

To save the OpenAPI spec in YAML format, you can use the `js-yaml` package. First, install the package:

```package-install
js-yaml
```

Then, you can modify the script to save the spec in YAML format:

```ts
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { generateSpecs } from 'hono-openapi';
import yaml from 'js-yaml';

// Your Hono app
import mainApp from "./app";

async function main() {
    const specs = await generateSpecs(mainApp, {
        // Documentation metadata
    });

    fs.writeFileSync('./path/to/openapi.yaml', yaml.dump(specs));
}

main()
```

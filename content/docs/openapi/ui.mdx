description: Generating OpenAPI specifications based docs
---

Once you get your OpenAPI spec, you can use it to generate documentation for your API. This is super useful when working with teams or when you want to provide a easy way for others to understand your API.

## Scalar

To use Scalar, you need to install the `@scalar/hono-api-reference` package.

```package-install
@scalar/hono-api-reference
```

Assuming you are serving your OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json`, you can use Scalar to generate the documentation like this

```ts
import { Scalar } from "@scalar/hono-api-reference";

app.get(
  "/docs",
  Scalar({
    theme: "saturn",
    url: "/openapi.json",
  })
);
```

Navigating to `/docs` will now show you the documentation for your API. Scalar provides a beautiful and interactive way to explore your API, making it easy for developers to understand how to use it. You can learn more about this at [Scalar's documentation](https://guides.scalar.com/scalar/scalar-api-references/integrations/hono).

## Swagger UI

To use Swagger UI, you need to install the `@hono/swagger-ui` package.

```package-install
@hono/swagger-ui
```

Assuming you are serving your OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json`, you can use Swagger UI to generate the documentation like this

```ts
import { swaggerUI } from '@hono/swagger-ui'

app.get(
  '/docs',
  swaggerUI({
    url: '/openapi.json',
  })
)
```

Navigating to `/docs` will now show you the documentation for your API. You can learn more about this at [@hono/swagger-ui's documentation](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/swagger-ui).

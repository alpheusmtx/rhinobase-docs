## Hide Routes

You can conditionally hide routes from the OpenAPI specification by using the `hide` property in the `describeRoute` function. This is useful when you want to hide certain routes in production or based on some environment variable.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    // ...
    hide: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  }),
  (c) => {
    return c.text("Private Route");
  }
);
```

You can also pass a function to the `hide` property which will be called with the context object.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    hide: ({ c, path, method }) => c.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  }),
);
```

<Callout title="Note">
The `c` object is the context object which you passed in `openAPIRouteHandler` or `generateSpecs` function. The `path` and `method` properties are the path and method of the current route. This is useful when you want to globally declare the function to hide routes.

## OperationId

Out of the box, the `describeRoute` function will generate a unique operationId for each route. This is useful for generating the OpenAPI specification. However, in some cases, you might want to manually set the operationId for a route. You can do this by passing the `operationId` property to the `describeRoute` function.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    operationId: "getHello",
  }),
);
```

You can also pass a function to the `operationId` property which will be called with the route object.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    operationId: (route) => `${route.method}-${route.path}`,
  }),
);
```

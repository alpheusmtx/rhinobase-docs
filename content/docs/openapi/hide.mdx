title: Hiding Routes
description: Conditionally hide routes from the OpenAPI specification
---

You can conditionally hide routes from the OpenAPI specification by using the `hide` property in the `describeRoute` function. This is useful when you want to hide certain routes in production or based on some environment variable.

```ts
app.get(
  "/",
  describeRoute({
    // ...
    hide: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  }),
  (c) => {
    return c.text("Private Route");
  }
);
```
